# ussdmap
ussdmap

## What does it do?
Generates a tree or map of a USSD menu, and also enumerates all the "absolute paths" under a USSD menu.

## Why use this?
If you want to know what menu items are in a USSD menu, use this.

## Why did I build this?
I build this because I couldn't find something that does this.

## What do you need to run it?
You will need a SIM Card, a USB modem, Asterisk installed, credit on your phone if the USSD "endpoint" you're calling charges money.
